[![GitHub Repository]](https://github.com/Moatezslim)

## Overview

The Cryptography Application is a powerful tool designed for secure data handling and encryption. It supports AES and RSA algorithms, along with a suite of plugins for enhanced functionality, including Base64 encoding, file hashing, integrity monitoring, and steganography. This comprehensive application is ideal for developers and security enthusiasts alike.

### Key Features

- **AES Encryption & Decryption**: Fast and secure symmetric encryption for data protection.
- **RSA Encryption & Decryption**: Asymmetric encryption for secure key exchange and data integrity.
- **Base64 Encoding/Decoding**: Easily convert binary data to ASCII text and vice versa.
- **File Hashing**: Generate hashes of files to verify integrity and authenticity (SHA-256, MD5).
- **Integrity Monitor**: Track changes to files and data with real-time alerts.
- **Steganography**: Hide data within images and other file types for covert communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for seamless navigation and usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language for the application logic.
- **PyQt**: For creating a responsive user interface.
- **Cryptography Library**: For implementing AES and RSA algorithms.
- **OpenCV**: For steganography functionalities.
- **SQLite**: For managing user data and application settings.
